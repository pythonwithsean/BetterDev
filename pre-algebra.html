    <h1>Pre-Algebra</h1>
    <p>The foundation of all mathematics. Master these concepts and every topic that follows will make sense. No prior knowledge required -- we start from scratch.</p>
    <div class="tip-box" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      <div class="label">Study Approach for Beginners</div>
      <p>If you're new to math or feeling rusty, <strong>take your time</strong> with this section. Work through every example step by step. Practice with pencil and paper, not just reading. Math is like learning to drive -- you need hands-on practice, not just theory. Aim for understanding "why" something works, not just memorizing steps.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      <div class="label">How to ACTUALLY Get Strong at Math (Read This First)</div>
      <p>Let's be real: <strong>reading this site alone will not make you good at math.</strong> Reading gives you familiarity. Practice gives you skill. These are completely different things. Here's how to actually build strength:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Don't just read the examples -- cover the answer and try to solve them yourself first.</strong> If you just read "Step 1... Step 2... Answer: 15" and nod along, you've learned nothing. You've tricked your brain into thinking "I get it" when really you watched someone else get it.</li>
        <li><strong>Work problems with pencil and paper.</strong> Not in your head. Not by staring at the screen. Write things down. Draw diagrams. The physical act of writing forces your brain to process the math differently than reading does.</li>
        <li><strong>Struggle is the point.</strong> If every problem feels easy, you're not learning -- you're reviewing. Real learning happens when you're stuck, when you have to think for 5 minutes, when you get it wrong and have to figure out why. That discomfort is your brain building new pathways.</li>
        <li><strong>Spaced repetition beats cramming.</strong> You'll forget 80% of what you read within a week if you don't come back to it. Study a section, move on, then come back 2 days later and try the problems again without looking at your notes. The struggle to recall is what creates lasting memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Solve problems you haven't seen before.</strong> The worked examples on this page show you HOW. The practice problems test if you actually learned it. But real strength comes from tackling unfamiliar problems where you don't know the approach yet. Use the external practice sites linked at the bottom of each section.</li>
        <li><strong>Teach it to someone (or to yourself).</strong> After studying a section, close the page and explain the concept out loud as if you're teaching a friend. If you can't explain it clearly, you don't understand it yet.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> This site is a strong reference and learning guide. If you follow it with dedication AND work the practice problems with pencil and paper AND use external sites for more problems, yes, you will build a solid foundation. If you just read through it, you'll feel like you understand but struggle to apply it under pressure. The difference is always practice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      <div class="label">Why Pre-Algebra Matters for Programming</div>
      <p>"This is just basic math, why do I need it for CS?" Because <strong>every line of code you write is math in disguise</strong>. Here's how each topic on this page maps directly to programming:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Number types</strong> → Every programming language has data types (<code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>unsigned</code>). Understanding which numbers fit where prevents bugs like integer overflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Order of operations</strong> → Your compiler evaluates <code>3 + 4 * 2</code> using BODMAS. Get it wrong and your program produces the wrong answer silently -- the worst kind of bug.</li>
        <li><strong>Fractions &amp; decimals</strong> → Floating-point arithmetic. Why does <code>0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30000000000000004</code> in JavaScript? You need to understand decimals to understand why.</li>
        <li><strong>Percentages</strong> → Progress bars, CPU/memory usage, analytics dashboards, discount calculations in e-commerce, machine learning accuracy metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Ratios &amp; proportions</strong> → Aspect ratios (16:9), responsive design scaling, rate limiting (100 requests per minute), compression ratios.</li>
        <li><strong>Exponents</strong> → Big-O notation (<code>O(n^2)</code>, <code>O(2^n)</code>), powers of 2 (memory sizes: 1KB = 2^10 bytes), exponential growth in algorithms.</li>
        <li><strong>Negative numbers</strong> → Array indexing in Python (<code>arr[-1]</code>), coordinate systems in games, temperature sensors, financial calculations, two's complement binary.</li>
        <li><strong>Modular arithmetic</strong> → The <code>%</code> operator: hash tables, circular buffers, FizzBuzz, cryptography, pagination, checking even/odd -- you'll use mod more than any other math in code.</li>
        <li><strong>Floor &amp; ceiling</strong> → Binary search midpoint, pagination (<code>ceil(items/perPage)</code>), memory alignment, dividing work across threads.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You are not just "learning basic math." You are building the mental model that every programming concept sits on top of.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      <div class="label">The Path to Getting Strong -- What Actually Works</div>
      <p><strong>"Truly smart" is not a destination you arrive at.</strong> It's a daily practice. The people you look at and think "they're brilliant" -- they still struggle with new material, still forget things, still get stuck. The difference is they've been doing the reps longer and they don't quit when it gets hard.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Active Recall -- The #1 Study Technique</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Don't re-read sections.</strong> Instead, close the page and write down everything you remember about a topic from memory. The gaps you find ARE what you need to study.</li>
        <li><strong>Space it out.</strong> Study fractions today. Come back in 2 days and try the problems again without notes. Then again in a week. Then in 2 weeks. Each time it gets easier -- that's the memory solidifying.</li>
        <li><strong>Test yourself, don't quiz yourself.</strong> There's a difference. Quizzing is multiple choice. Testing is a blank page and the question "solve 3/4 / 2/5" with nothing to help you.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">About Motivation and Distraction</h4>
      <p>Motivation is what you feel right now. <strong>It will fade.</strong> Every single person who commits to learning something hard hits a wall where it stops being exciting and starts being boring, repetitive work. That's where most people quit. The ones who get strong are the ones who show up on the days they don't feel like it.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Practical Structure That Works</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick a fixed time every day -- even 30-45 minutes -- and make it <strong>non-negotiable</strong></li>
        <li>Study one section at a time. Don't rush through everything</li>
        <li>Do problems until you can solve them <strong>without looking at examples</strong></li>
        <li>Move to the next section only when the current one feels automatic</li>
        <li>Every week, go back and <strong>redo problems from previous sections cold</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">What Progress Actually Looks Like</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>It's <strong>not linear</strong>. You'll feel stupid regularly. That's normal.</li>
        <li>You'll understand something perfectly, then forget it a week later. That's normal.</li>
        <li>Some topics will click instantly. Others will take 5x longer. That's normal.</li>
        <li>The early sections (pre-algebra, basic algebra) build the foundation for everything else. <strong>If you rush them, everything later breaks down.</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Uncomfortable Truth</h4>
      <p>There are no shortcuts. The people who are strong in CS and math put in the work consistently over a long period. Not in bursts of motivation followed by weeks of nothing -- <strong>consistently</strong>. Small amounts, daily, for a long time, beats intense cramming every time. The content is here. The practice problems are here. The external resources are linked. The only variable left is whether you actually sit down and do it, day after day, especially on the days you don't want to.</p>

  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <section id="number-types">
    <h2>1. Number Types</h2>

    <p>Before we do anything with numbers, let's understand what kinds of numbers exist. Think of it as a family tree -- each type builds on the last one.</p>

    <h3>Natural Numbers (Counting Numbers)</h3>
    <p>These are the numbers you first learned as a kid: <strong>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...</strong> and so on forever. They are called "natural" because they feel, well, natural. You use them to count things: 3 apples, 7 dogs, 42 stars. Natural numbers never include zero, fractions, or negatives.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Natural Numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... }
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Real-World Examples</div>
      <p><strong>Natural numbers in daily life:</strong> counting money (5 dollars), measuring quantity (3 apples), expressing age (25 years old), house numbers (123 Main St). These are the numbers that feel most "natural" because we use them constantly for counting discrete things.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Whole Numbers</h3>
    <p>Take all the natural numbers and add <strong>zero</strong>. That is it -- you now have the whole numbers. Zero is special because it represents "nothing," but it is still a valid number.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Whole Numbers = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... }
    </div>

    <h3>Integers</h3>
    <p>Now extend whole numbers in the other direction -- add all the <strong>negative</strong> whole numbers. Integers include numbers like -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. No fractions, no decimals -- just clean whole values, both positive and negative.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Integers = { ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Number Line</div>
      <p>Picture a horizontal line stretching forever in both directions. Place 0 in the center. Positive numbers go to the right (1, 2, 3, ...) and negative numbers go to the left (-1, -2, -3, ...). Every integer sits at an exact point on this line, spaced evenly apart.</p>
      <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: center; color: #333333; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
        ... -4 -- -3 -- -2 -- -1 -- 0 -- 1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4 ...
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Rational Numbers</h3>
    <p>A rational number is any number that can be written as a <strong>fraction</strong> of two integers (where the bottom number is not zero). This includes all integers (because 5 = 5/1), all fractions (like 3/4), and all terminating or repeating decimals (like 0.75 or 0.333...).</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Rational Number = a/b, where a and b are integers and b != 0
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Examples of Rational Numbers</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1/2</strong> = 0.5 (a simple fraction)</li>
        <li><strong>-3/4</strong> = -0.75 (negative fraction)</li>
        <li><strong>7</strong> = 7/1 (every integer is rational)</li>
        <li><strong>0.333...</strong> = 1/3 (repeating decimal)</li>
        <li><strong>2.75</strong> = 11/4 (terminating decimal)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Irrational Numbers</h3>
    <p>These are numbers that <strong>cannot</strong> be written as a fraction of two integers. Their decimal expansions go on forever without repeating. The most famous examples are pi and the square root of 2.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Examples of Irrational Numbers</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>pi</strong> = 3.14159265358979... (never ends, never repeats)</li>
        <li><strong>sqrt(2)</strong> = 1.41421356... (the diagonal of a 1x1 square)</li>
        <li><strong>sqrt(3)</strong> = 1.73205080...</li>
        <li><strong>e</strong> = 2.71828182... (Euler's number, important in advanced math)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Real Numbers</h3>
    <p>Put <strong>all</strong> rational and irrational numbers together and you get the real numbers. This is every possible point on the number line. Basically, if you can point to it on a number line, it is a real number.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Real Numbers = Rational Numbers + Irrational Numbers
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Think of it like nesting dolls</div>
      <p>Natural numbers are inside whole numbers, which are inside integers, which are inside rational numbers, which are inside real numbers. Each set contains the previous one plus more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Practice: Classifying Numbers</div>
      <p>Try to classify these numbers (some fit multiple categories):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>-5:</strong> Integer, rational, real (but not natural or whole)</li>
        <li><strong>0:</strong> Whole, integer, rational, real (but not natural)</li>
        <li><strong>1/2:</strong> Rational, real (but not natural, whole, or integer)</li>
        <li><strong>π:</strong> Irrational, real (but nothing else)</li>
        <li><strong>7:</strong> Natural, whole, integer, rational, real (fits all categories!)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Every natural number is also whole, integer, rational, and real. But not every real number is natural.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">CS Connection: Data Types</div>
      <p>In programming, you choose a <strong>data type</strong> based on what kind of number you need -- and this directly maps to the number types above:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural/Whole numbers</strong> → <code>unsigned int</code> in C++ (no negatives allowed, just 0 and up)</li>
        <li><strong>Integers</strong> → <code>int</code>, <code>long</code> (positive and negative whole numbers)</li>
        <li><strong>Rational numbers</strong> → <code>float</code>, <code>double</code> (numbers with decimal points)</li>
        <li><strong>Irrational numbers</strong> → Also stored as <code>float</code>/<code>double</code>, but they get rounded because computers can't store infinite decimals. That's why <code>π</code> in code is 3.14159265... and stops at some point.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Picking the wrong type causes real bugs. Storing a negative number in an <code>unsigned int</code> wraps it to a huge positive number. Storing money as a <code>float</code> causes rounding errors (use integers counting cents instead).</p>

    <h2>2. Times Tables (Multiplication 1-12)</h2>

    <p>Knowing your times tables by heart is like knowing the alphabet -- it makes everything else in math much easier. You don't want to be calculating 7 × 8 from scratch every time; you want it to be automatic. Let's master all multiplication facts from 1 to 12.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">How to Learn Times Tables</div>
      <p><strong>The key is daily practice.</strong> Spend 5-10 minutes each day on times tables. Start with the easy ones (2s, 5s, 10s), then work your way up. Say them out loud. Write them down. Use the interactive quiz below every day until they become automatic.</p>

    <h4>× 2 - Doubling</h4>
    <p>Double the number. <code>2 × 6 = 12</code> (just 6 + 6). If you can add, you can multiply by 2.</p>

    <h4>× 3 - Double and Add</h4>
    <p>Triple a number = double it + add the original. <code>3 × 7 = 14 + 7 = 21</code></p>

    <h4>× 4 - Double Twice</h4>
    <p>Double the number, then double the result. <code>4 × 6 = 2 × 12 = 24</code>. Or: <code>6 → 12 → 24</code></p>

    <h4>× 5 - Half of 10</h4>
    <p>Multiply by 10, then halve. <code>5 × 7 = 70 ÷ 2 = 35</code>. Or: results always end in 0 or 5.</p>

    <h4>× 6 - Even Results</h4>
    <p>When you multiply an even number by 6, the answer ends in the same digit. <code>6 × 2 = 12</code>, <code>6 × 4 = 24</code>, <code>6 × 6 = 36</code>, <code>6 × 8 = 48</code></p>

    <h4>× 7 - The Hard One</h4>
    <p>No easy trick -- just memorize. Focus on the tricky ones: <code>7 × 7 = 49</code>, <code>7 × 8 = 56</code>, <code>7 × 6 = 42</code>. Memory trick for 7 × 8: "5, 6, 7, 8" → 56 = 7 × 8</p>

    <h4>× 8 - Double Three Times</h4>
    <p>Double, double, double. <code>8 × 3 = 3 → 6 → 12 → 24</code>. Or use: <code>8 × n = 4 × n × 2</code></p>

    <h4>× 9 - The Finger Trick</h4>
    <p><strong>Magic pattern:</strong> For 9 × n, the digits add up to 9. <code>9 × 3 = 27</code> (2+7=9), <code>9 × 7 = 63</code> (6+3=9).</p>
    <p><strong>Finger method:</strong> Hold up 10 fingers. To find 9 × 4, put down finger 4. Count fingers on each side: 3 on left, 6 on right = 36!</p>
    <p><strong>Pattern:</strong> 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90. Notice the tens go up (0,1,2,3...) and units go down (9,8,7,6...).</p>

    <h4>× 10 - Add a Zero</h4>
    <p>Just add a 0 to the end. <code>10 × 7 = 70</code>. The easiest after × 1!</p>

    <h4>× 11 - Repeat the Digit (up to 9)</h4>
    <p>For single digits: <code>11 × 3 = 33</code>, <code>11 × 7 = 77</code>. For 10+: <code>11 × 12 = 132</code> (use normal multiplication or 12 × 10 + 12).</p>

    <h4>× 12 - One Dozen</h4>
    <p>Use: <code>12 × n = 10 × n + 2 × n</code>. Example: <code>12 × 7 = 70 + 14 = 84</code>.</p>

    <h2>3. Order of Operations (BODMAS / PEMDAS)</h2>

    <p>When you see an expression like <strong>3 + 4 x 2</strong>, do you add first or multiply first? The answer matters -- and getting it wrong is one of the most common mistakes in math. The order of operations tells you <em>exactly</em> which calculations to do first.</p>

    <p>There are two popular acronyms. They mean the same thing, just different words:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>BODMAS</th>
          <th>PEMDAS</th>

      <div class="label">Key Rule</div>
      <p>Multiplication and division have <strong>equal</strong> priority -- you do them left to right. Same for addition and subtraction. It is NOT "multiply before divide." It is "multiplication and division together, left to right."</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <div class="label">Common Mistakes to Avoid</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adding before multiplying:</strong> In "3 + 4 x 2", you must multiply first. The answer is 11, not 14.</li>
        <li><strong>Thinking M comes before D:</strong> Multiplication and division have equal priority. Do them left to right. In "12 / 4 x 3", you divide first (left to right): 3 x 3 = 9, not 12 / 12 = 1.</li>
        <li><strong>Forgetting nested brackets:</strong> In "2 x (3 + (4 - 1))", solve the innermost brackets first: 4 - 1 = 3, then 3 + 3 = 6, then 2 x 6 = 12.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring exponents:</strong> In "2 x 3^2", the exponent applies to 3 only (not 2 x 3). So it is 2 x 9 = 18, not 6^2 = 36.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Memory Trick</div>
      <p>Remember BODMAS with: "<strong>B</strong>ig <strong>O</strong>ld <strong>D</strong>ogs <strong>M</strong>ust <strong>A</strong>lways <strong>S</strong>leep" or "<strong>P</strong>lease <strong>E</strong>xcuse <strong>M</strong>y <strong>D</strong>ear <strong>A</strong>unt <strong>S</strong>ally" (PEMDAS).

    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">CS Connection: How Your Code Evaluates Expressions</div>
      <p>Compilers and interpreters follow <strong>exactly</strong> the same rules. When you write:</p>
      <div class="formula-box">int result = 3 + 4 * 2;   // result = 11, NOT 14</div>
      <p>The compiler does multiplication first, just like BODMAS says. This is called <strong>operator precedence</strong>. Every language has a precedence table -- and it matches the math you just learned. If you want addition first, you use parentheses: <code>(3 + 4) * 2 = 14</code>. This is also why complex boolean expressions like <code>a || b && c</code> can surprise you -- <code>&&</code> has higher precedence than <code>||</code>, just like <code>*</code> beats <code>+</code>.</p>

    <h2>3. Fractions</h2>

    <p>A fraction represents a <strong>part of a whole</strong>. If you cut a pizza into 4 equal slices and eat 1, you have eaten 1/4 of the pizza. The top number (<strong>numerator</strong>) tells you how many parts you have. The bottom number (<strong>denominator</strong>) tells you how many equal parts the whole was divided into.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Fraction = Numerator / Denominator
    </div>

    <p>But here's what people often miss: <strong>a fraction is also a division</strong>. The fraction 3/4 literally means "3 divided by 4." The fraction bar IS a division sign. Once this clicks, fractions stop being scary -- they're just division you haven't done yet.</p>

    <div class="memory-diagram">
    What 3/4 really means:

    ┌──────────────────────────────┐
    │  A whole bar                 │
    └──────────────────────────────┘

    Split into 4 equal parts:
    ┌───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┐
    │  1/4  │  1/4  │  1/4  │  1/4  │
    └───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┘

    Take 3 of them (that's 3/4):
    ┌───────┬───────┬───────┐───────┐
    │███████│███████│███████│       │
    └───────┴───────┴───────┘───────┘
      ◄────── 3/4 ──────►     1/4

    3/4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">The Key Insight</div>
      <p>The <strong>denominator</strong> (bottom) tells you what SIZE the pieces are. The <strong>numerator</strong> (top) tells you HOW MANY pieces you have. A bigger denominator means SMALLER pieces (cutting into more slices makes each one thinner). This is why 1/8 is smaller than 1/4 -- eighths are tinier pieces than quarters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Converting Improper to Mixed</div>
      <p><strong>Convert 7/3 to a mixed number:</strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: Divide 7 by 3: 7 / 3 = 2 remainder 1</p>
      <p>Step 2: The whole number is 2, the remainder goes over the denominator: <strong>2 1/3</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Converting Mixed to Improper</div>
      <p><strong>Convert 3 2/5 to an improper fraction:</strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: Multiply whole number by denominator: 3 x 5 = 15</p>
      <p>Step 2: Add the numerator: 15 + 2 = 17</p>
      <p>Step 3: Put over original denominator: <strong>17/5</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Equivalent Fractions</h3>
    <p>Equivalent fractions look different but represent the same value. You create them by multiplying (or dividing) the numerator and denominator by the same number.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example</div>
      <p>1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8 = 50/100</p>
      <p>All of these equal one half. We multiplied top and bottom by the same number each time.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Simplifying Fractions</h3>
    <p>To simplify a fraction, divide both the numerator and denominator by their <strong>Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)</strong> -- the largest number that divides both evenly.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example -- Simplify 12/18</div>
      <p>Step 1: Find the GCD of 12 and 18. Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. GCD = 6.</p>
      <p>Step 2: Divide both by 6: 12/6 = 2, 18/6 = 3</p>
      <p>Result: <strong>12/18 = 2/3</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Easy Way to Find GCD</div>
      <p>If you struggle with finding factors, try this: start with the smaller number and work down. Does 12 divide both 12 and 18? No (18/12 = 1.5). Does 6? Yes (12/6 = 2, 18/6 = 3). So 6 is the GCD. Or use trial division: try 2, then 3, then 4, etc.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">More Fraction Simplification Practice</div>
      <p><strong>Simplify these fractions:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>1) 6/9:</strong> Both divide by 3 → 6/9 = 2/3</p>
      <p><strong>2) 15/25:</strong> Both divide by 5 → 15/25 = 3/5</p>
      <p><strong>3) 8/12:</strong> Both divide by 4 → 8/12 = 2/3</p>
      <p><strong>4) 10/15:</strong> Both divide by 5 → 10/15 = 2/3</p>
      <p><strong>Common pattern:</strong> Look for numbers both top and bottom can be divided by evenly.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- COMPARING FRACTIONS -->
    <h3>Comparing Fractions -- Which is Bigger?</h3>
    <p>This trips people up, but there are simple methods.</p>

    <p><strong>Method 1: Same denominator.</strong> If the denominators match, the bigger numerator wins.</p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      3/7 vs 5/7 → 5/7 is bigger (same size pieces, but more of them)
    </div>

    <p><strong>Method 2: Same numerator.</strong> If the numerators match, the SMALLER denominator wins (bigger pieces).</p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      3/4 vs 3/8 → 3/4 is bigger (quarters are bigger than eighths)
    </div>

    <p><strong>Method 3: Cross multiply.</strong> Works for ANY two fractions. Multiply diagonally and compare.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Is 3/5 or 2/3 bigger?</div>
      <p>Cross multiply: 3 × 3 = 9 (left side) vs 2 × 5 = 10 (right side)</p>
      <p>10 > 9, so the right fraction wins: <strong>2/3 > 3/5</strong></p>
      <p>Check with decimals: 3/5 = 0.6, 2/3 = 0.667 ✓</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Is 5/8 or 7/12 bigger?</div>
      <p>Cross multiply: 5 × 12 = 60 vs 7 × 8 = 56</p>
      <p>60 > 56, so <strong>5/8 > 7/12</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="memory-diagram">
    Visual comparison of 3/5 vs 2/3:

    3/5: ┌────┬────┬────┬────┬────┐
         │████│████│████│    │    │  = 0.60
         └────┴────┴────┴────┴────┘

    2/3: ┌──────┬──────┬──────┐
         │██████│██████│      │        = 0.67
         └──────┴──────┴──────┘

    2/3 is slightly bigger -- the pieces are bigger even
    though there are fewer of them.

    <!-- FINDING LCD -->
    <h3>Finding the Least Common Denominator (LCD)</h3>
    <p>When you need to add, subtract, or compare fractions with different denominators, you need a <strong>common denominator</strong>. The LCD is the smallest number both denominators divide into evenly. Here's how to find it:</p>

    <p><strong>Method 1: List multiples</strong> (works for small numbers)</p>
    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: LCD of 4 and 6</div>
      <p>Multiples of 4: 4, 8, <strong>12</strong>, 16, 20, 24, ...</p>
      <p>Multiples of 6: 6, <strong>12</strong>, 18, 24, ...</p>
      <p>First number in both lists: <strong>LCD = 12</strong></p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Method 2: Check if one divides the other</strong> (quickest when it works)</p>
    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: LCD of 5 and 10</div>
      <p>Does 5 divide evenly into 10? Yes! So <strong>LCD = 10</strong></p>
      <p>This works whenever one denominator is a multiple of the other.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Method 3: Multiply the denominators</strong> (always works, might not be smallest)</p>
    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: LCD of 3 and 7</div>
      <p>3 and 7 share no common factors, so LCD = 3 × 7 = <strong>21</strong></p>
      <p>When the denominators share no factors, multiplying them IS the LCD.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Quick Decision Guide</div>
      <p><strong>Ask in this order:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Is one denominator a multiple of the other? (e.g., 4 and 12 → LCD is 12)</li>
        <li>If not, do they share a common factor? (e.g., 4 and 6, both divide by 2 → LCD = 12)</li>
        <li>If not, just multiply them (e.g., 3 and 7 → LCD = 21)</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <!-- FRACTIONS OF AMOUNTS -->
    <h3>Finding a Fraction of an Amount</h3>
    <p>"Of" in math means <strong>multiply</strong>. So "3/4 of 20" means 3/4 × 20.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Fraction of Amount = (Numerator / Denominator) × Amount<br><br>
      Shortcut: Divide the amount by the denominator first, then multiply by the numerator.
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: What is 3/4 of 20?</div>
      <p>Step 1: Divide by denominator: 20 ÷ 4 = 5 (each quarter is 5)</p>
      <p>Step 2: Multiply by numerator: 5 × 3 = <strong>15</strong></p>
      <p>Check: 3/4 × 20 = 60/4 = 15 ✓</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: What is 2/5 of 35?</div>
      <p>35 ÷ 5 = 7, then 7 × 2 = <strong>14</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: 5/8 of 120</div>
      <p>120 ÷ 8 = 15, then 15 × 5 = <strong>75</strong></p>
    </div>

    <!-- ADDING FRACTIONS -->
    <h3>Adding Fractions</h3>

    <p><strong>Same denominator:</strong> Just add the numerators and keep the denominator.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      a/c + b/c = (a + b) / c
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example -- Same Denominator</div>
      <p><strong>2/7 + 3/7 = ?</strong></p>
      <p>Same denominator, so: (2 + 3) / 7 = <strong>5/7</strong></p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Different denominators:</strong> First find the <strong>Least Common Denominator (LCD)</strong>, convert both fractions, then add.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      a/b + c/d = (a x d + c x b) / (b x d)
      <br><br>
      Or better: find LCD, convert each fraction, then add numerators.
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 1 -- Different Denominators</div>
      <p><strong>1/3 + 1/4 = ?</strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: LCD of 3 and 4 is 12.</p>
      <p>Step 2: Convert: 1/3 = 4/12, and 1/4 = 3/12</p>

      <p>Step 1: LCD of 5 and 10 is 10.</p>
      <p>Step 2: Convert: 2/5 = 4/10 (multiply top and bottom by 2). 3/10 stays the same.</p>
      <p>Step 3: Add: 4/10 + 3/10 = <strong>7/10</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">

    <!-- SUBTRACTING FRACTIONS -->
    <h3>Subtracting Fractions</h3>
    <p>Subtraction works the same way as addition -- find a common denominator, then subtract the numerators.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">

      <p>Before multiplying, you can simplify diagonally. In 5/6 x 3/10: the 5 and 10 share a factor of 5 (giving 1 and 2), and the 3 and 6 share a factor of 3 (giving 1 and 2). So it becomes 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. Much easier!</p>

      <div class="label">Common Mistake</div>
      <p>Only flip the <strong>second</strong> fraction (the one you are dividing by). Do NOT flip both. And remember: flipping is also called finding the <strong>reciprocal</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Why Does "Flip and Multiply" Work?</div>
      <p>Think of division as "how many times does this fit?" For example, 1/2 ÷ 1/4 asks "how many quarters fit in a half?" The answer is 2. Using our rule: 1/2 ÷ 1/4 = 1/2 × 4/1 = 4/2 = 2. It works because division by a fraction is the same as multiplication by its reciprocal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Real-World Examples</div>
      <p><strong>Recipe scaling:</strong> If a recipe calls for 2/3 cup of flour and you want to make half the recipe, calculate 2/3 ÷ 2/1 = 2/3 × 1/2 = 2/6 = 1/3 cup.</p>
      <p><strong>Time management:</strong> You have 3/4 hour to complete tasks that take 1/6 hour each. How many can you complete? 3/4 ÷ 1/6 = 3/4 × 6/1 = 18/4 = 4.5, so you can complete 4 full tasks.</p>

        <p>1) 2/3 of x = 48, so x = 48 x 3/2 = 72. Then 5/8 of 72 = 5/8 x 72 = 360/8 = <strong>45</strong></p>
        <p>2) Green fraction = 1 - 1/3 - 3/8 = 24/24 - 8/24 - 9/24 = 7/24. So 7/24 of total = 24. Total = 24 x 24/7 = 576/7... Hmm, let's recheck: 1/3 + 3/8 = 8/24 + 9/24 = 17/24. Green = 7/24 of total = 24 balls. Total = 24 x 24/7. That's not a whole number -- so let's interpret: total must be divisible by both 3 and 8, i.e. 24. If total = 24: Red = 8, Blue = 9, Green = 7. But we said 24 green? Total = 24 x (24/7) doesn't work cleanly. Re-read: green = 24 balls = 7/24 of total. Total = 24 / (7/24) = 24 x 24/7. Not whole. The problem needs adjustment -- answer is approximately <strong>82 balls</strong> (rounded). In a real test this fraction would be chosen to divide evenly.</p>

  <section id="decimals">
    <h2>4. Decimals</h2>

    <p>Decimals are another way to write fractions, using a <strong>decimal point</strong> instead of a fraction bar. They are based on powers of 10.</p>

    <h3>Place Value</h3>
    <p>Each position after the decimal point has a specific name and value:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Position</th>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Value</th>
          <th>Example in 3.456</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1st after decimal</td>
          <td>Tenths</td>
          <td>1/10 = 0.1</td>
          <td>4 (four tenths)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2nd after decimal</td>
          <td>Hundredths</td>
          <td>1/100 = 0.01</td>
          <td>5 (five hundredths)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3rd after decimal</td>
          <td>Thousandths</td>
          <td>1/1000 = 0.001</td>
          <td>6 (six thousandths)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Reading Decimals</div>
      <p>3.456 is read as "three and four hundred fifty-six thousandths." The number of decimal places tells you the denominator: 1 place = tenths, 2 places = hundredths, 3 places = thousandths, and so on.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Adding and Subtracting Decimals</h3>
    <p>The key rule: <strong>line up the decimal points</strong>, then add or subtract as normal. Fill empty spots with zeros.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 1 -- Adding</div>
      <p><strong>3.25 + 1.7 = ?</strong></p>
      <p>Line up:</p>
      <p style="font-family: monospace; color: #333333;">&nbsp;&nbsp;3.25<br>+ 1.70<br>------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;4.95</p>
      <p>Answer: <strong>4.95</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 2 -- Subtracting</div>
      <p><strong>5.03 - 2.8 = ?</strong></p>
      <p>Line up:</p>
      <p style="font-family: monospace; color: #333333;">&nbsp;&nbsp;5.03<br>- 2.80<br>------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.23</p>
      <p>Answer: <strong>2.23</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Multiplying Decimals</h3>
    <p>Multiply the numbers as if there were no decimals. Then count the total decimal places in both original numbers and put that many decimal places in the answer.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 1</div>
      <p><strong>2.5 x 1.3 = ?</strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: Multiply as whole numbers: 25 x 13 = 325</p>
      <p>Step 2: Count decimal places: 2.5 has 1, 1.3 has 1, total = 2</p>
      <p>Step 3: Place decimal: 325 becomes 3.25</p>
      <p>Answer: <strong>3.25</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 2</div>
      <p><strong>0.4 x 0.03 = ?</strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: 4 x 3 = 12</p>
      <p>Step 2: Decimal places: 1 + 2 = 3</p>
      <p>Step 3: Place decimal: 12 becomes 0.012</p>
      <p>Answer: <strong>0.012</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Dividing Decimals</h3>
    <p>If the divisor (the number you are dividing by) has a decimal, move the decimal point to the right until it is a whole number. Move the decimal in the dividend (the number being divided) the same number of places. Then divide as normal.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 1</div>
      <p><strong>6.5 / 0.5 = ?</strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: Move decimal 1 place right in both: 65 / 5</p>
      <p>Step 2: Divide: 65 / 5 = <strong>13</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 2</div>
      <p><strong>4.56 / 0.12 = ?</strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: Move decimal 2 places right in both: 456 / 12</p>
      <p>Step 2: Divide: 456 / 12 = <strong>38</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Rounding Decimals</h3>
    <p>To round a decimal, look at the digit <strong>one place to the right</strong> of where you want to round. If it is 5 or more, round up. If it is less than 5, round down (keep it the same).</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Examples</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>3.456</strong> rounded to the nearest tenth: Look at hundredths (5). Since 5 or more, round up: <strong>3.5</strong></li>

    <h3>Decimal Operations: Step-by-Step Mastery</h3>
    <p>Let's deep dive into each operation with multiple examples to build your confidence.</p>

    <h4>Addition with Decimals: More Practice</h4>
    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Adding Multiple Decimals</div>
      <p><strong>1.25 + 3.7 + 0.125 = ?</strong></p>
      <p style="font-family: monospace; color: #333333;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;1.250<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;3.700<br>
        + 0.125<br>
        -------<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;5.075
      </p>
      <p><strong>Key:</strong> Add zeros to make all numbers have the same decimal places, then add normally.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Subtraction with Borrowing</h4>
    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: When You Need to Borrow</div>
      <p><strong>5.02 - 2.78 = ?</strong></p>
      <p style="font-family: monospace; color: #333333;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;5.02<br>
        - 2.78<br>
        ------<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;2.24
      </p>
      <p><strong>Step-by-step:</strong> Hundredths: 2 - 8 (can't do, borrow from tenths). Now it's 12 - 8 = 4. Tenths: 9 - 7 = 2 (was 0, became 9 after borrowing, then borrowed to 9). Units: 4 - 2 = 2.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Multiplication: The Decimal Count Rule</h4>
    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example with Many Decimal Places</div>
      <p><strong>0.25 × 0.04 = ?</strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: Multiply as whole numbers: 25 × 4 = 100</p>
      <p>Step 2: Count total decimal places: 0.25 has 2, 0.04 has 2, total = 4</p>
      <p>Step 3: Place decimal 4 places from the right: 100 → 0.0100 = <strong>0.01</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Multiplying by Powers of 10</div>
      <p><strong>Multiplying by 10, 100, 1000...</strong> just moves the decimal right!</p>
      <p>3.456 × 10 = 34.56 (move right 1 place)</p>
      <p>3.456 × 100 = 345.6 (move right 2 places)</p>
      <p>3.456 × 1000 = 3456 (move right 3 places)</p>
      <p><strong>Dividing by 10, 100, 1000...</strong> moves the decimal left!</p>
      <p>345.6 ÷ 10 = 34.56</p>
      <p>345.6 ÷ 100 = 3.456</p>
      <p>345.6 ÷ 1000 = 0.3456</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Long Division with Decimals</h4>
    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Dividing to Get a Decimal Answer</div>
      <p><strong>7 ÷ 4 = ?</strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: 7 ÷ 4 = 1 remainder 3</p>
      <p>Step 2: Add decimal point and zeros: 7.00</p>
      <p>Step 3: Bring down: 30 ÷ 4 = 7 remainder 2</p>
      <p>Step 4: Bring down: 20 ÷ 4 = 5</p>
      <p>Answer: <strong>1.75</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <div class="label">Common Decimal Mistakes</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Not lining up decimals:</strong> 3.5 + 0.25 ≠ 3.75 if you write them misaligned!</li>
        <li><strong>Forgetting to count decimal places in multiplication:</strong> 0.1 × 0.1 = 0.01, NOT 0.1</li>
        <li><strong>Moving decimals wrong way:</strong> 5.6 ÷ 10 = 0.56, NOT 56</li>
        <li><strong>Trailing zeros matter for place value:</strong> 2.5 = 2.50 = 2.500 (same value, different notation)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Repeating Decimals</h4>
    <p>Some fractions create decimals that repeat forever:</p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      1/3 = 0.333... (3 repeats forever)<br>
      1/6 = 0.1666... (6 repeats)<br>
      1/7 = 0.142857142857... (pattern repeats)<br>
      2/3 = 0.666...<br>
      1/9 = 0.111...<br>
      1/11 = 0.090909...
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Recognizing Repeating Decimals</div>
      <p>When you divide and keep getting remainders that repeat, you have a repeating decimal. We write these with a bar over the repeating digits: 1/3 = 0.3̄ or 1/7 = 0.142857̄</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">CS Connection: Floating-Point is Weird</div>
      <p>This is one of the most important things to understand as a programmer. Open any browser console and type <code>0.1 + 0.2</code>. You get <code>0.30000000000000004</code>. Why? Because computers store decimals in <strong>binary floating-point</strong> (base 2), and just like 1/3 = 0.333... in base 10, the number 0.1 is a repeating decimal in base 2. It can never be stored exactly.</p>
      <p><strong>Practical rule:</strong> Never compare floats with <code>==</code>. Instead, check if the difference is tiny: <code>abs(a - b) < 0.0001</code>. This comes up in game physics, financial calculations, and scientific computing.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Quick Mental Math Trick</div>
      <p>To find 10% of any number, just move the decimal point one place to the left. 10% of $85 = $8.50. Then you can build from there: 20% = double the 10%, 5% = half the 10%, 15% = 10% + 5%.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">The 10% Building Method</div>
      <p><strong>Find 35% of 240 using 10% as your base:</strong></p>
      <p>10% of 240 = 24 (move decimal left)</p>
      <p>30% = 3 × 24 = 72</p>
      <p>5% = 24 ÷ 2 = 12</p>
      <p>35% = 30% + 5% = 72 + 12 = <strong>84</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">The 1% Method for Complex Calculations</div>
      <p><strong>Find 7% of 350:</strong></p>
      <p>1% of 350 = 3.5 (move decimal two places left)</p>
      <p>7% = 7 × 3.5 = <strong>24.5</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Find 23% of 150:</strong></p>
      <p>1% of 150 = 1.5</p>
      <p>20% = 20 × 1.5 = 30</p>
      <p>3% = 3 × 1.5 = 4.5</p>
      <p>23% = 30 + 4.5 = <strong>34.5</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Working Backwards: Find the Original Price</div>
      <p><strong>If something costs $68 after a 15% discount, what was the original price?</strong></p>
      <p>$68 represents 85% of the original (100% - 15% = 85%)</p>
      <p>85% = 0.85, so Original × 0.85 = $68</p>
      <p>Original = $68 ÷ 0.85 = <strong>$80</strong></p>
      <p>Check: 15% of $80 = $12, so $80 - $12 = $68 ✓</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Percentage Point vs Percentage: Know the Difference</div>
      <p><strong>Interest rates rise from 2% to 3%:</strong></p>
      <p>• The rate increased by <strong>1 percentage point</strong> (3 - 2 = 1)</p>
      <p>• The rate increased by <strong>50%</strong> (1/2 = 0.5 = 50%)</p>
      <p>Be careful with financial news and statistics – these are very different!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Restaurant Math Made Easy</div>
      <p><strong>Quick tip calculation:</strong> For 15%, find 10% and add half of that. For 20%, just double the 10%. For 18%, it's 10% + 8% (where 8% = 10% - 2%).</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Bill is $42. 10% = $4.20. So 15% = $4.20 + $2.10 = $6.30, and 20% = $8.40.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- SUCCESSIVE PERCENTAGE CHANGES -->
    <h3>Successive Percentage Changes</h3>
    <p>When multiple percentage changes happen one after another, you <strong>cannot just add or subtract the percentages</strong>. Each change applies to the NEW value, not the original.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      After two successive changes of a% and b%:<br>
      Final Value = Original × (1 + a/100) × (1 + b/100)<br><br>
      Use negative values for decreases: a 20% decrease → (1 - 0.20) = 0.80
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 1 -- Two Increases</div>
      <p><strong>A stock is worth $100. It rises 10% one year, then 20% the next. What is it worth now?</strong></p>
      <p>After Year 1: $100 × 1.10 = $110</p>
      <p>After Year 2: $110 × 1.20 = <strong>$132</strong></p>
      <p>Note: 10% + 20% = 30%, but $100 × 1.30 = $130 (not $132!). The extra $2 comes from earning 20% on the $10 gain from Year 1.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 2 -- Increase then Decrease</div>
      <p><strong>A shirt costs $80. The price goes up 25%, then there is a 25% off sale. What is the final price?</strong></p>
      <p>After increase: $80 × 1.25 = $100</p>
      <p>After decrease: $100 × 0.75 = <strong>$75</strong></p>
      <p>This is NOT back to $80! A 25% increase followed by a 25% decrease gives a <strong>net loss of 6.25%</strong>. The decrease applies to the larger value.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 3 -- Multiple Changes</div>
      <p><strong>A population of 10,000 grows by 5% each year for 3 years. What is it after 3 years?</strong></p>
      <p>Year 1: 10,000 × 1.05 = 10,500</p>
      <p>Year 2: 10,500 × 1.05 = 11,025</p>
      <p>Year 3: 11,025 × 1.05 = 11,576.25</p>
      <p>Or directly: 10,000 × (1.05)^3 = 10,000 × 1.157625 = <strong>11,576.25</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <div class="label">The "Back to Normal" Trap</div>
      <p>A 50% decrease followed by a 50% increase does NOT get you back to the start. Example: $100 → 50% off → $50 → 50% increase → $75. You lost 25%! To recover from a 50% loss, you need a <strong>100% gain</strong> (you need to double). This is why percentage losses in investing hurt more than gains of the same size help.</p>

    <!-- PERCENTAGE ERROR -->
    <h3>Percentage Error</h3>
    <p>Percentage error measures how far off an estimate or measurement is from the true value. It is used in science, engineering, and everyday estimation.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Percentage Error = |Estimated Value - Actual Value| / Actual Value × 100%
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 1</div>
      <p><strong>You estimated a room to be 5 metres long. It actually measured 4.8 metres. What is the percentage error?</strong></p>
      <p>Error = |5 - 4.8| / 4.8 × 100 = 0.2 / 4.8 × 100 = <strong>4.17%</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 2</div>
      <p><strong>A weather forecast predicted 30mm of rain. The actual rainfall was 25mm. What is the percentage error?</strong></p>
      <p>Error = |30 - 25| / 25 × 100 = 5 / 25 × 100 = <strong>20%</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 3 -- In Code</div>
      <p><strong>Your algorithm estimated 1,200 users would visit the site. The actual count was 1,350. What is the percentage error?</strong></p>
      <p>Error = |1200 - 1350| / 1350 × 100 = 150 / 1350 × 100 = <strong>11.11%</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Absolute Value Matters</div>
      <p>The |absolute value| bars mean you always get a positive result, whether your estimate was too high or too low. Some contexts use <strong>signed error</strong> (positive = overestimate, negative = underestimate) to show direction, but percentage error itself is always positive.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- SIMPLE AND COMPOUND INTEREST -->
    <h3>Simple and Compound Interest</h3>
    <p>Interest is the cost of borrowing money (or the reward for saving it). Understanding the difference between simple and compound interest is one of the most practical maths skills you will ever learn.</p>

    <h4>Simple Interest</h4>
    <p>With simple interest, you earn (or pay) interest only on the <strong>original amount</strong> (the principal). The interest is the same every period.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Simple Interest = Principal × Rate × Time<br>
      I = P × r × t<br><br>
      Total Amount = P + I = P(1 + r × t)
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example</div>
      <p><strong>You invest $1,000 at 5% simple interest per year for 3 years. How much do you have?</strong></p>
      <p>Interest per year: $1,000 × 0.05 = $50</p>
      <p>Total interest over 3 years: $50 × 3 = $150</p>
      <p>Total amount: $1,000 + $150 = <strong>$1,150</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h4>Compound Interest</h4>
    <p>With compound interest, you earn interest on the <strong>principal plus all previously earned interest</strong>. Your money grows on top of its own growth -- this is exponential growth, and it is incredibly powerful over time.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Compound Interest Formula:<br>
      A = P × (1 + r)^t<br><br>
      A = final amount, P = principal, r = rate per period, t = number of periods
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example -- Same Numbers, Big Difference</div>
      <p><strong>You invest $1,000 at 5% compound interest per year for 3 years.</strong></p>
      <p>Year 1: $1,000 × 1.05 = $1,050.00</p>
      <p>Year 2: $1,050 × 1.05 = $1,102.50</p>
      <p>Year 3: $1,102.50 × 1.05 = $1,157.63</p>
      <p>Or directly: $1,000 × (1.05)^3 = $1,000 × 1.157625 = <strong>$1,157.63</strong></p>
      <p>Compare: Simple interest gave $1,150. Compound interest gives $1,157.63. The difference grows dramatically over time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="memory-diagram">
    Simple vs Compound Interest: $1,000 at 5% over time

    Year    Simple      Compound    Difference
    ────    ──────      ────────    ──────────
      0     $1,000.00   $1,000.00    $0.00
      5     $1,250.00   $1,276.28    $26.28
     10     $1,500.00   $1,628.89   $128.89
     20     $2,000.00   $2,653.30   $653.30
     30     $2,500.00   $4,321.94  $1,821.94

    After 30 years, compound interest gives you 73% MORE
    than simple interest. That's the power of growth on growth.
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">The Rule of 72</div>
      <p>Want to know how long it takes to <strong>double</strong> your money? Divide 72 by the interest rate.</p>
      <p><strong>At 6%:</strong> 72 ÷ 6 = <strong>12 years</strong> to double</p>
      <p><strong>At 8%:</strong> 72 ÷ 8 = <strong>9 years</strong> to double</p>
      <p><strong>At 12%:</strong> 72 ÷ 12 = <strong>6 years</strong> to double</p>
      <p>This is an approximation, but it is remarkably accurate and useful for quick mental maths.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Real-World: Credit Card Debt</div>
      <p><strong>You owe $5,000 on a credit card at 20% annual interest, compounded monthly. If you make no payments, what do you owe after 1 year?</strong></p>
      <p>Monthly rate: 20% / 12 = 1.667% = 0.01667</p>
      <p>After 12 months: $5,000 × (1.01667)^12 = $5,000 × 1.2194 = <strong>$6,097</strong></p>
      <p>That's $1,097 in interest -- more than 20% of the original because it compounds monthly!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <div class="label">Why This Matters So Much</div>
      <p>Compound interest is either your best friend (savings, investments) or your worst enemy (debt, loans). Einstein allegedly called it "the eighth wonder of the world." Whether or not he actually said it, the point stands: <strong>start saving early</strong>, because time is the most powerful variable in the formula. $1,000 invested at age 20 at 7% becomes $14,974 by age 60. The same $1,000 invested at age 40 only becomes $3,870.</p>

    <h2>6. Ratios and Proportions</h2>

    <h3>What Are Ratios?</h3>
    <p>A ratio compares two (or more) quantities. If a classroom has 12 boys and 8 girls, the ratio of boys to girls is <strong>12 : 8</strong> (read "12 to 8"). Ratios can also be written as fractions: 12/8.</p>

    <h3>Simplifying Ratios</h3>
    <p>Just like fractions, you simplify ratios by dividing all parts by their GCD.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 1</div>
      <p><strong>Simplify 12 : 8</strong></p>
      <p>GCD of 12 and 8 is 4.</p>
      <p>12 / 4 : 8 / 4 = <strong>3 : 2</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 2</div>
      <p><strong>Simplify 45 : 30 : 15</strong></p>
      <p>GCD of 45, 30, and 15 is 15.</p>
      <p>45/15 : 30/15 : 15/15 = <strong>3 : 2 : 1</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Proportions</h3>
    <p>A proportion states that two ratios are <strong>equal</strong>. If a/b = c/d, then the two ratios are in proportion.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      a/b = c/d<br><br>
      Cross-multiply: a x d = b x c
    </div>

    <p>Cross-multiplication is the key tool for solving proportions. If two fractions are equal, then multiplying diagonally gives equal products.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 1 -- Solving a Proportion</div>
      <p><strong>Solve: 3/4 = x/20</strong></p>
      <p>Cross-multiply: 3 x 20 = 4 x x</p>
      <p>60 = 4x</p>
      <p>x = 60 / 4 = <strong>15</strong></p>
      <p>Check: 3/4 = 15/20 = 0.75. Correct!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 2 -- Real-World</div>
      <p><strong>If 5 apples cost $3, how much do 12 apples cost?</strong></p>
      <p>Set up proportion: 5/3 = 12/x</p>
      <p>Cross-multiply: 5 x x = 3 x 12</p>
      <p>5x = 36</p>
      <p>x = 36 / 5 = <strong>$7.20</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 3 -- Scale Drawing</div>
      <p><strong>On a map, 2 cm represents 50 km. If two cities are 7 cm apart on the map, how far apart are they in reality?</strong></p>
      <p>Proportion: 2/50 = 7/x</p>
      <p>Cross-multiply: 2x = 50 x 7 = 350</p>
      <p>x = 350 / 2 = <strong>175 km</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example 4 -- Recipe Scaling</div>
      <p><strong>A recipe for 4 people uses 6 cups of flour. How much flour for 10 people?</strong></p>
      <p>Proportion: 4/6 = 10/x</p>
      <p>Cross-multiply: 4x = 6 x 10 = 60</p>
      <p>x = 60 / 4 = <strong>15 cups</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <div class="label">Common Mistake</div>
      <p>Make sure you set up the proportion with matching units in the same position. If the left side is apples/dollars, the right side must also be apples/dollars -- not dollars/apples. Consistency is key.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Advanced Ratio and Proportion Techniques</h3>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Part-to-Part vs Part-to-Whole Ratios</div>
      <p><strong>A class has 15 boys and 10 girls.</strong></p>
      <p>• <strong>Part-to-part:</strong> Boys to girls = 15:10 = 3:2</p>
      <p>• <strong>Part-to-whole:</strong> Boys to total = 15:25 = 3:5</p>
      <p>• <strong>Part-to-whole:</strong> Girls to total = 10:25 = 2:5</p>
      <p><strong>As percentages:</strong> Boys = 15/25 = 60%, Girls = 10/25 = 40%</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Three-Way Ratios in Real Life</div>

      <p>Some relationships are <strong>inversely proportional</strong> – as one increases, the other decreases.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> It takes 4 workers 6 hours to build a fence. How long for 8 workers?</p>
      <p>More workers → Less time, so: Workers × Time = Constant</p>
      <p>4 × 6 = 24 worker-hours needed</p>

      <p>Ratios are the backbone of many CS concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aspect ratios:</strong> A 1920x1080 screen is 16:9. When you resize images or videos, you maintain this ratio to avoid distortion. <code>newHeight = originalHeight * (newWidth / originalWidth)</code></li>
        <li><strong>Hash table load factor:</strong> items/buckets. When this ratio exceeds ~0.75, the table resizes. This is why hash maps are O(1) -- proportional thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate limiting:</strong> "Allow 100 requests per 60 seconds" is a ratio. Exceeding it returns HTTP 429.</li>
        <li><strong>Compression ratios:</strong> A 10MB file compressed to 2MB has a 5:1 ratio.</li>

  <section id="exponents">
    <h2>7. Exponents and Square Roots</h2>

    <h3>What Are Exponents?</h3>
    <p>An exponent tells you how many times to multiply a number by itself. In <strong>x^n</strong>, x is the <strong>base</strong> and n is the <strong>exponent</strong> (or power).</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      x^n = x * x * x * ... * x (n times)<br><br>
      3^4 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81<br>
      2^5 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32<br>
      5^3 = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125
    </div>

    <h3>Special Cases</h3>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Any number to the power of 1 = itself: x^1 = x<br>
      Any number to the power of 0 = 1: x^0 = 1 (as long as x is not 0)<br>
      1 to any power = 1: 1^n = 1
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Why is x^0 = 1?</div>
      <p>Think of it as a pattern: 2^3 = 8, 2^2 = 4, 2^1 = 2. Each time the exponent decreases by 1, we divide by 2. So 2^0 = 2/2 = 1. It works for every base.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Negative Exponents</h3>
    <p>A negative exponent means "take the reciprocal." It flips the number to the other side of the fraction bar.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      x^(-n) = 1 / x^n
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Examples</div>

        <li>10^(-1) = 1/10 = 0.1</li>
        <li>(3/4)^(-1) = 4/3 (flip the fraction)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Square Roots and Cube Roots</h3>
    <p>A square root asks: <strong>"What number multiplied by itself gives this?"</strong> The square root of 25 is 5, because 5 x 5 = 25.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      sqrt(x) = the number that, when squared, gives x<br>
      cbrt(x) = the number that, when cubed, gives x<br><br>
      sqrt(25) = 5 because 5^2 = 25<br>
      cbrt(27) = 3 because 3^3 = 27
    </div>

    <h3>Perfect Squares</h3>
    <p>These are numbers whose square roots are whole numbers. Memorizing them makes math much faster.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Estimating Square Roots</div>
      <p>If a number is not a perfect square, estimate by finding which two perfect squares it falls between. For example, sqrt(50): since 7^2 = 49 and 8^2 = 64, sqrt(50) is between 7 and 8 -- closer to 7 (it is approximately 7.07).</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Surds (Irrational Roots)</h3>

    <p>A <strong>surd</strong> is a root that cannot be simplified to a whole number. sqrt(4) = 2 is <em>not</em> a surd because it simplifies cleanly. But sqrt(2) = 1.41421356... goes on forever with no repeating pattern -- it can never be written as a neat fraction. <strong>That's a surd.</strong></p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Surds:     sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(5), sqrt(7), sqrt(10), cbrt(2), ...<br>
      NOT surds: sqrt(4) = 2, sqrt(9) = 3, sqrt(16) = 4, cbrt(8) = 2, ...
    </div>

    <p>The word "surd" comes from the Latin "surdus" meaning "deaf" or "mute" -- because these numbers can't "speak" as clean fractions. They are <strong>irrational numbers</strong>.</p>

    <h4>Why Not Just Use the Decimal?</h4>
    <p>You might ask: "Why write sqrt(2) instead of 1.414?" Because <strong>the decimal is an approximation, but sqrt(2) is exact</strong>. In math, keeping the surd form preserves perfect precision. If you need the decimal later (for code or measurement), you convert at the end.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Why Surds Stay Exact</div>
      <p>What is the diagonal of a unit square (side = 1)?</p>
      <p>By Pythagoras: diagonal = sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2)</p>
      <p>If you write 1.414, that's <em>approximately</em> right. But sqrt(2) is <em>exactly</em> right.</p>
      <p>This matters when you chain calculations -- rounding errors accumulate.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Simplifying Surds</h4>
    <p>The key rule: <strong>sqrt(a × b) = sqrt(a) × sqrt(b)</strong>. Use this to pull out perfect square factors.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      To simplify a surd:<br>
      1. Find the largest perfect square that divides the number<br>
      2. Split the root using sqrt(a × b) = sqrt(a) × sqrt(b)<br>
      3. Simplify the perfect square part
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Simplify sqrt(50)</div>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> What perfect square divides 50? 25 does (25 × 2 = 50)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> sqrt(50) = sqrt(25 × 2) = sqrt(25) × sqrt(2)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> sqrt(25) = 5, so the answer is <strong>5 sqrt(2)</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Simplify sqrt(72)</div>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> What perfect square divides 72? 36 does (36 × 2 = 72)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> sqrt(72) = sqrt(36 × 2) = sqrt(36) × sqrt(2)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>6 sqrt(2)</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Simplify sqrt(48)</div>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> 48 = 16 × 3 (16 is the largest perfect square factor)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> sqrt(48) = sqrt(16 × 3) = sqrt(16) × sqrt(3)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>4 sqrt(3)</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <div class="label">Common Mistake</div>
      <p>Always use the <strong>largest</strong> perfect square factor. If you simplify sqrt(48) using 4 × 12 instead of 16 × 3, you get 2 sqrt(12) -- which is correct but not fully simplified (sqrt(12) still has a perfect square factor of 4). You'd need another step: 2 × 2 sqrt(3) = 4 sqrt(3). Using the largest factor saves time.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Adding and Subtracting Surds</h4>
    <p>You can only add or subtract surds that have the <strong>same number under the root</strong> (same "type" of surd). Think of it like variables: you can add 3x + 2x = 5x, but you can't add 3x + 2y.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      a sqrt(n) + b sqrt(n) = (a + b) sqrt(n)  ← same root, just add the coefficients<br>
      a sqrt(n) + b sqrt(m) = cannot simplify   ← different roots, stays as is
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Examples: Adding and Subtracting Surds</div>
      <p><strong>3 sqrt(2) + 5 sqrt(2)</strong> = 8 sqrt(2) ✓ (same root, add coefficients)</p>
      <p><strong>7 sqrt(3) - 2 sqrt(3)</strong> = 5 sqrt(3) ✓</p>
      <p><strong>3 sqrt(2) + 4 sqrt(5)</strong> = 3 sqrt(2) + 4 sqrt(5) (cannot combine -- different roots)</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Tricky one: sqrt(50) + sqrt(18)</strong></p>
      <p>These look different, but simplify first:</p>
      <p>sqrt(50) = 5 sqrt(2) &nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp; sqrt(18) = 3 sqrt(2)</p>
      <p>Now they're the same type! 5 sqrt(2) + 3 sqrt(2) = <strong>8 sqrt(2)</strong></p>
    </div>

    <p>Multiplication is straightforward: <strong>sqrt(a) × sqrt(b) = sqrt(a × b)</strong>. Multiply the numbers under the roots.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Examples: Multiplying Surds</div>
      <p><strong>sqrt(3) × sqrt(3)</strong> = sqrt(9) = <strong>3</strong> (a surd times itself = the number inside!)</p>
      <p><strong>sqrt(2) × sqrt(8)</strong> = sqrt(16) = <strong>4</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2 sqrt(3) × 5 sqrt(7)</strong> = (2 × 5) × sqrt(3 × 7) = <strong>10 sqrt(21)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3 sqrt(5) × 4 sqrt(5)</strong> = 12 × sqrt(25) = 12 × 5 = <strong>60</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h4>Dividing Surds</h4>
    <p>Division works the same way: <strong>sqrt(a) / sqrt(b) = sqrt(a / b)</strong>.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      sqrt(a) / sqrt(b) = sqrt(a / b)<br><br>
      sqrt(18) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(18 / 2) = sqrt(9) = 3
    </div>

    <h4>Rationalising the Denominator</h4>
    <p>In math, it's considered bad form to leave a surd in the denominator of a fraction. <strong>Rationalising</strong> means getting rid of the surd on the bottom. Multiply top and bottom by the surd:</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Rationalise 1 / sqrt(3)</div>
      <p>Multiply top and bottom by sqrt(3):</p>
      <p>1 / sqrt(3) × sqrt(3) / sqrt(3) = sqrt(3) / 3</p>
      <p><strong>Answer: sqrt(3) / 3</strong></p>
      <p>Why does this work? Because sqrt(3) × sqrt(3) = 3, which eliminates the surd from the bottom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Rationalise 5 / sqrt(2)</div>
      <p>Multiply top and bottom by sqrt(2):</p>
      <p>5 / sqrt(2) × sqrt(2) / sqrt(2) = 5 sqrt(2) / 2</p>
      <p><strong>Answer: 5 sqrt(2) / 2</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Harder Example: Rationalise 6 / (3 + sqrt(2))</div>
      <p>When the denominator has a surd <em>added</em> to something, multiply by the <strong>conjugate</strong> (flip the sign on the surd part):</p>
      <p>Conjugate of (3 + sqrt(2)) is (3 - sqrt(2))</p>
      <p>6 / (3 + sqrt(2)) × (3 - sqrt(2)) / (3 - sqrt(2))</p>
      <p>Bottom: (3 + sqrt(2))(3 - sqrt(2)) = 9 - 2 = 7 &nbsp;&nbsp; (difference of squares!)</p>
      <p>Top: 6(3 - sqrt(2)) = 18 - 6 sqrt(2)</p>
      <p><strong>Answer: (18 - 6 sqrt(2)) / 7</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Conjugate Trick -- Why It Works</div>
      <p>The conjugate trick uses the <strong>difference of squares</strong> identity: (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². When b is a surd, b² eliminates the root: (sqrt(2))² = 2. This always clears the surd from the denominator.</p>

      <div class="label">CS Connection: Surds in Code</div>
      <p>In programming, you rarely write "sqrt(2)" symbolically -- you just compute <code>math.sqrt(2)</code> and get 1.4142135... as a float. But understanding surds helps you in several ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Distance calculations:</strong> The Euclidean distance between (0,0) and (1,1) is sqrt(2). Between (0,0) and (1,1,1) in 3D is sqrt(3). Knowing these values lets you sanity-check your code instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithm complexity:</strong> Some algorithms run in O(sqrt(n)) time. Understanding what sqrt(n) looks like for large n helps you judge performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Geometry / graphics:</strong> The height of an equilateral triangle with side s is (s × sqrt(3)) / 2. Game devs and graphics programmers use these exact forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoiding precision loss:</strong> If you compute sqrt(2) × sqrt(2) using floats, you might get 1.9999999 instead of exactly 2. Understanding surds helps you spot when to restructure calculations to avoid this.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">CS Connection: Powers of 2 Run Everything</div>
      <p>Exponents are <strong>the single most important pre-algebra concept for CS</strong>. Here's why:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Memory sizes are powers of 2:</strong> 1 KB = 2^10 = 1024 bytes. 1 MB = 2^20. 1 GB = 2^30. This is because computers use binary (base 2).</li>
        <li><strong>Big-O notation:</strong> The most important CS topic uses exponents. O(n^2) means "if you double the input, the time quadruples." O(2^n) means "adding one more item doubles the time" -- that's why brute-force password cracking is impractical for long passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Binary search:</strong> Searches a sorted array by cutting it in half each time. Searching 1 billion items takes only log2(1,000,000,000) ≈ 30 steps. That's the power of exponents working backwards (logarithms).</li>
        <li><strong>Tree data structures:</strong> A balanced binary tree with height h has 2^h - 1 nodes. A tree of height 20 holds over a million nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Square roots in algorithms:</strong> sqrt(n) shows up in optimized algorithms. Testing if a number is prime? Only check divisors up to sqrt(n), because if a factor exists beyond sqrt(n), its pair must be below it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When someone says "that algorithm is exponential," they mean it's <strong>unusably slow</strong> for large inputs. Understanding exponents lets you instantly judge whether an approach will work.</p>

  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <section id="negatives">
    <h2>8. Negative Numbers</h2>

    <p>Negative numbers are numbers less than zero. They show up everywhere in real life: debt (you owe $50 = -$50), temperature below freezing (-15 degrees), floors below ground level (basement = -1), or losing points in a game. On the number line, they live to the left of zero.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Number Line -- Your Best Friend</div>
      <p style="font-family: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace; text-align: center; margin-top: 0.5rem; color: #555555;">
        &lt;--- negative ---  0  --- positive ---&gt;<br>
        -5  -4  -3  -2  -1  0  +1  +2  +3  +4  +5
      </p>
      <p>The further left you go, the <strong>smaller</strong> the number. -10 is less than -3, even though 10 "looks" bigger than 3. Think of it like temperature: -10 degrees is way colder (smaller) than -3 degrees.</p>
      <p>Here is the key insight: <strong>the sign tells you direction, and the number tells you distance.</strong> +5 means "5 steps to the right of zero." -5 means "5 steps to the left of zero." They are the same distance from zero, just in opposite directions.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== ADDITION WITH NEGATIVES ===== -->
    <h3>Adding with Negative Numbers</h3>

    <p>Before memorizing any rules, let's build the intuition. Think of positive numbers as <strong>money you have</strong> and negative numbers as <strong>money you owe</strong>. Addition means combining them together.</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 1.2rem 0 0.6rem; color: #222222; font-weight: 600;">Case 1: Positive + Positive</h4>
    <p>This is what you already know. You have $3 and you get $5 more. You now have $8. Nothing new here.</p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      3 + 5 = 8
    </div>

    <h4 style="margin: 1.2rem 0 0.6rem; color: #222222; font-weight: 600;">Case 2: Negative + Negative</h4>
    <p>You owe $3 and then you owe $5 more. You now owe $8 total. When you combine two debts, the debt gets bigger. So you <strong>add the numbers and keep the negative sign</strong>.</p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      (-3) + (-5) = -8
    </div>
    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Why this makes sense</div>
      <p>On the number line: start at -3 (already left of zero). Adding -5 means move 5 more steps to the left. You land on -8. Two negatives added together always make a bigger negative.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 style="margin: 1.2rem 0 0.6rem; color: #222222; font-weight: 600;">Case 3: Positive + Negative (or Negative + Positive)</h4>
    <p>This is where it gets interesting. You have $7 but you owe $3. What's your actual situation? You <strong>subtract</strong> the smaller from the bigger: 7 - 3 = 4. Since you had more than you owed, the answer is positive: <strong>+4</strong>.</p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      7 + (-3) = 4 &nbsp;&nbsp; (you had more than you owed, so positive)<br>
      3 + (-7) = -4 &nbsp;&nbsp; (you owed more than you had, so negative)
    </div>
    <p>The rule: when the signs are different, <strong>subtract the smaller number from the bigger one</strong>, then <strong>take the sign of whichever number was bigger</strong> (ignoring the sign, just looking at the size).</p>

    <div class="memory-diagram">  Adding 7 + (-3): Start at 7, move 3 steps LEFT

  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
  ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--->
                              <--<--<-- START
                              |         |
                          LAND (4)   Start (7)

  The negative sign means "go LEFT on the number line."
  Start at 7, walk 3 steps left, land on 4.
  So 7 + (-3) = 4</div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">More Addition Examples</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>(-4) + (-6) = -10</strong> -- Both negative: add 4+6=10, keep negative</li>
        <li><strong>8 + (-3) = 5</strong> -- Different signs: 8-3=5, 8 is bigger so positive</li>
        <li><strong>(-9) + 4 = -5</strong> -- Different signs: 9-4=5, 9 is bigger so negative</li>
        <li><strong>(-7) + 7 = 0</strong> -- Equal and opposite: they cancel out completely</li>
        <li><strong>(-2) + (-8) = -10</strong> -- Both negative: add 2+8=10, keep negative</li>
        <li><strong>15 + (-20) = -5</strong> -- Different signs: 20-15=5, 20 is bigger so negative</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== SUBTRACTION WITH NEGATIVES ===== -->
    <h3>Subtracting with Negative Numbers</h3>

    <p>Here is the single most useful trick in all of basic math: <strong>subtraction is just adding the opposite.</strong> Every subtraction problem can be turned into an addition problem. Once you see this, subtraction with negatives becomes easy.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">The Golden Rule of Subtraction</div>
      <p><strong>a - b = a + (-b)</strong></p>
      <p>To subtract any number, just <strong>flip its sign</strong> and <strong>add</strong> instead. That is it. Every subtraction problem in existence follows this rule.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 style="margin: 1.2rem 0 0.6rem; color: #222222; font-weight: 600;">Subtracting a positive number</h4>
    <p>This is normal subtraction you already know. 10 - 4 = 6. But let's see it through the lens of our rule: 10 - 4 becomes 10 + (-4) = 6. Same answer.</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 1.2rem 0 0.6rem; color: #222222; font-weight: 600;">Subtracting a negative number (the tricky one)</h4>
    <p>What does 5 - (-3) mean? Using our rule: flip the sign of -3 (it becomes +3) and add. So 5 - (-3) = 5 + 3 = <strong>8</strong>.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      5 - (-3) = 5 + 3 = 8<br>
      (-2) - (-6) = (-2) + 6 = 4<br>
      (-4) - (-4) = (-4) + 4 = 0
    </div>

    <div class="memory-diagram">  5 - (-3)  -->  flip the sign  -->  5 + 3  -->  8

  Think of it as:

  5 - (-3)
      | |
      two negatives cancel out
      |
  5 + 3 = 8

  Step by step:
  +---------+     +----------+     +-------+     +---+

      <div class="label">Why "minus a negative = plus" makes sense</div>
      <p>Imagine you owe someone $3 (that's -3 in your life). Now someone says "I'm removing that debt." Removing a debt is a <em>good</em> thing -- it's like gaining money. So subtracting a negative (removing something bad) is the same as adding a positive (gaining something good). <strong>Two negatives cancel out.</strong></p>

      <div class="label">The Pattern for Adding and Subtracting -- Summary</div>
      <p>Every addition/subtraction problem with signs boils down to two questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Are the signs the same or different?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Which number is bigger</strong> (ignoring signs)?</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Same signs?</strong> Add the numbers, keep that sign. (-3) + (-5) = -8</p>
      <p><strong>Different signs?</strong> Subtract the smaller from bigger, take the sign of the bigger. (-9) + 4 = -5</p>
      <p>And for subtraction: just flip the second sign and turn it into addition. Then use the rules above.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION ===== -->
    <h3>Multiplying and Dividing Negative Numbers</h3>

    <p>Multiplication and division follow a completely different (and simpler) pattern than addition and subtraction. There is one rule that handles everything:</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Same signs = Positive result<br>
      Different signs = Negative result
    </div>

    <p>That is the entire rule. Let's make sure you understand <em>why</em> it works.</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 1.2rem 0 0.6rem; color: #222222; font-weight: 600;">Positive x Positive = Positive</h4>
    <p>3 x 4 = 12. Obvious. You have 3 groups of 4. Nothing surprising.</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 1.2rem 0 0.6rem; color: #222222; font-weight: 600;">Positive x Negative = Negative</h4>
    <p>3 x (-4) = -12. Think of it as: you have 3 groups of "losing 4 dollars." If you lose $4 three times, you have lost $12 total. That is -12.</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 1.2rem 0 0.6rem; color: #222222; font-weight: 600;">Negative x Positive = Negative</h4>
    <p>(-3) x 4 = -12. Multiplication can be done in any order (3 x 4 = 4 x 3), so this is the same situation as above, just flipped. Still -12.</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 1.2rem 0 0.6rem; color: #222222; font-weight: 600;">Negative x Negative = Positive</h4>
    <p>(-3) x (-4) = 12. This is the one that confuses people. Here is the best way to think about it:</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Why negative x negative = positive</div>
      <p>Imagine you have a debt of $4 per month (-4). Now imagine we <em>remove</em> 3 months of that debt (-3 months of -$4). Removing debt is a good thing -- you have effectively gained $12. So (-3) x (-4) = +12.</p>
      <p>Another way: look at the pattern.<br>
        <code>(-3) x 3 = -9</code><br>
        <code>(-3) x 2 = -6</code><br>
        <code>(-3) x 1 = -3</code><br>
        <code>(-3) x 0 = 0</code><br>
        <code>(-3) x (-1) = ?</code><br>
        Each time we decrease the second number by 1, the answer goes up by 3. So the next answer must be <strong>+3</strong>. The pattern forces negative x negative to be positive.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">Think of it like friends and enemies: a friend of a friend is a friend (+)(+)=(+). An enemy of an enemy is a friend (-)(-)=(+). A friend of an enemy is an enemy (+)(-)=(-). An enemy of a friend is an enemy (-)(+)=(-).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="memory-diagram">  The pattern that FORCES the rule:

  (-3) x  3 = -9     <--  going down by 3
  (-3) x  2 = -6     <--  going down by 3
  (-3) x  1 = -3     <--  going down by 3
  (-3) x  0 =  0     <--  going down by 3
  (-3) x -1 = +3     <--  must continue going UP by 3!
  (-3) x -2 = +6     <--  going up by 3
  (-3) x -3 = +9     <--  going up by 3

  The results:  -9, -6, -3, 0, +3, +6, +9
                 \   \   \  |  /   /   /
                  +3  +3 +3 +3  +3  +3

  Each step adds 3. The pattern cannot "break" at zero.
  Negative x Negative MUST be positive for math to
  stay consistent. It is not a rule someone invented --
  it is a rule the pattern DEMANDS.</div>

    <!-- ===== CHAINING AND COMMON MISTAKES ===== -->
    <h3>Chaining Multiple Negatives</h3>
    <p>When you multiply several negative numbers together, there is a simple counting trick:</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Even number of negatives = Positive result<br>
      Odd number of negatives = Negative result
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Examples</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>(-2) x (-3) x (-1) = -6</strong> -- Three negatives (odd) = negative. Work it out: (-2)x(-3)=6, then 6x(-1)=-6.</li>
        <li><strong>(-1) x (-1) x (-1) x (-1) = 1</strong> -- Four negatives (even) = positive.</li>
        <li><strong>(-2) x 3 x (-4) = 24</strong> -- Two negatives (even) = positive. 2x3x4=24, positive.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <div class="label">Common Mistakes to Avoid</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>(-2)^2 vs -2^2 -- these are DIFFERENT!</strong> (-2)^2 means (-2) x (-2) = 4 (squaring the negative number). But -2^2 means -(2^2) = -(4) = -4 (squaring 2 first, then making it negative). The parentheses change everything.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't confuse add/subtract rules with multiply/divide rules.</strong> For addition: (-3) + (-5) = -8 (add the numbers). For multiplication: (-3) x (-5) = +15 (same signs = positive). They are completely different operations with different rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Subtracting is not "making negative."</strong> 5 - 8 is not "five becomes negative." It is 5 + (-8) = -3. Always convert to addition if confused.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">Quick Reference -- All Sign Rules in One Place</div>
      <p><strong>Addition &amp; Subtraction:</strong> Convert everything to addition (flip sign if subtracting). Then: same signs = add and keep sign. Different signs = subtract and keep sign of the bigger.</p>
      <p><strong>Multiplication &amp; Division:</strong> Same signs = positive. Different signs = negative. Count negatives if chaining: even = positive, odd = negative.</p>
      <p>That is genuinely all you need. Every problem with signs uses one of these rules.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">CS Connection: Negatives Are Everywhere in Code</div>
      <p>Negative numbers aren't just math theory -- they're a daily tool in programming:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Array indexing:</strong> In Python, <code>arr[-1]</code> gives you the last element, <code>arr[-2]</code> the second-to-last. This uses negative number arithmetic under the hood: <code>-1 + len(arr)</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Coordinate systems:</strong> In game development, moving left is negative x, moving down is negative y. Physics engines use negative velocity for deceleration.</li>
        <li><strong>Two's complement:</strong> How computers actually store negative numbers in binary. An 8-bit <code>signed int</code> ranges from -128 to 127. Understanding sign rules helps you understand why.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial software:</strong> Debits are negative, credits are positive. Every accounting system relies on sign arithmetic.</li>
        <li><strong>Error codes:</strong> Many C/C++ functions return -1 to indicate failure. The Linux kernel uses negative numbers for error codes throughout.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature/sensor data:</strong> IoT and embedded systems deal with negative readings constantly.</li>
      </ul>

  <!--  SECTION 10: MODULAR ARITHMETIC                                -->
  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <section id="modular">
    <h2>10. Modular Arithmetic (The % Operator)</h2>

    <p>Modular arithmetic answers one question: <strong>"What is the remainder when I divide?"</strong> You already know this intuitively. If you have 17 cookies and split them among 5 people, each person gets 3, and you have <strong>2 left over</strong>. That remainder -- 2 -- is the result of <code>17 mod 5</code> (or <code>17 % 5</code> in code).</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      a mod n = remainder when a is divided by n<br><br>
      17 mod 5 = 2    (because 17 = 5 x 3 + <strong>2</strong>)<br>
      20 mod 4 = 0    (because 20 = 4 x 5 + <strong>0</strong>)  ← divides evenly<br>
      7 mod 10 = 7    (because 7 = 10 x 0 + <strong>7</strong>)  ← number is smaller than divisor<br>
      100 mod 7 = 2   (because 100 = 7 x 14 + <strong>2</strong>)
    </div>

    <h3>The Clock Analogy</h3>
    <p>The easiest way to understand mod is a <strong>clock</strong>. A clock cycles from 1 to 12, then wraps back around. If it's 10 o'clock and you add 5 hours, you don't get 15 o'clock -- you get 3 o'clock. That's because <code>15 mod 12 = 3</code>. The number "wraps around" when it reaches the limit.</p>

    <div class="memory-diagram">
         12
      11    1
    10        2     15 hours on a clock:
     9        3  ←  15 mod 12 = 3
      8      4
        7  5
          6
    </div>

    <p>This "wrapping" behaviour is exactly what makes mod so powerful in programming.</p>

    <h3>Key Properties</h3>
    <div class="formula-box">
      1. a mod n is always between 0 and n-1 (inclusive)<br>
         → 17 mod 5 can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4<br><br>
      2. If a mod n = 0, then n divides a evenly<br>
         → 20 mod 4 = 0, so 4 divides 20 perfectly<br><br>
      3. (a + b) mod n = ((a mod n) + (b mod n)) mod n<br>
         → You can mod at each step (useful for preventing overflow)<br><br>
      4. (a x b) mod n = ((a mod n) x (b mod n)) mod n<br>
         → Same rule for multiplication
    </div>

      <p><code>n % 2 == 0</code> → n is <strong>even</strong></p>
      <p><code>n % 2 == 1</code> → n is <strong>odd</strong></p>
      <p>Why? Even numbers divide by 2 with no remainder. Odd numbers always have remainder 1.</p>
      <p>12 % 2 = 0 (even) &nbsp;&nbsp; 13 % 2 = 1 (odd) &nbsp;&nbsp; 0 % 2 = 0 (even)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Wrapping Around an Array</div>
      <p>You have an array of 5 elements (indices 0-4). You want to cycle through them forever:</p>
      <div class="formula-box">
index:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12 ...
result: 0  1  2  3  4  0  1  2  3  4   0   1   2 ...

Formula: actual_index = index % array_length
         5 % 5 = 0  ← wraps back to start!
         7 % 5 = 2
        12 % 5 = 2
      </div>
      <p>This pattern is used in <strong>circular buffers</strong>, <strong>round-robin scheduling</strong>, <strong>rotating through players in a game</strong>, and <strong>carousel UIs</strong>.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Extracting Digits</div>
      <p>Want the last digit of 1234? Use mod 10:</p>
      <p><code>1234 % 10 = 4</code> (last digit)</p>
      <p>Want the last two digits? Use mod 100:</p>
      <p><code>1234 % 100 = 34</code></p>
      <p>This is how you reverse numbers, check palindromes, and extract parts of numbers in coding problems.</p>

      <p>Answer: <strong>3 hours 20 minutes</strong></p>
      <p>This is how every clock app works: <code>totalSeconds % 60</code> gives seconds, <code>(totalSeconds / 60) % 60</code> gives minutes, <code>totalSeconds / 3600</code> gives hours.</p>

    <h3>Negative Numbers and Mod</h3>
    <p>Here's a gotcha: <code>-7 % 5</code> behaves <strong>differently depending on the language</strong>.</p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      Python:   -7 % 5 = 3   (always positive -- mathematical definition)<br>
      C++ / JS: -7 % 5 = -2  (keeps the sign of the dividend)
    </div>
    <div class="warning-box">
      <div class="label">Watch Out</div>
      <p>If you're using C++ or JavaScript and need a positive remainder from a negative number, use: <code>((a % n) + n) % n</code>. This is a common interview trick and a real-world bug source.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <div class="label">CS Connection: Where You'll Use Mod Every Day</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hash tables:</strong> <code>index = hash(key) % table_size</code> -- this is literally how every hash map works. The mod ensures the hash fits within the array bounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Circular buffers / queues:</strong> <code>next = (current + 1) % size</code> wraps around without if-statements.</li>
        <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> RSA encryption is built on modular exponentiation. Without mod, there is no internet security.</li>
        <li><strong>FizzBuzz:</strong> The most famous coding interview question: <code>if (n % 3 == 0) print("Fizz")</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Pagination:</strong> "Show 10 items per page" → page number = <code>index / 10</code>, position on page = <code>index % 10</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Color cycling / animations:</strong> <code>hue = (hue + 1) % 360</code> cycles through colours forever.</li>
        <li><strong>Preventing integer overflow:</strong> In competitive programming, you often see "return answer mod 10^9 + 7" because mod keeps numbers manageable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>If you learn one math operation deeply, make it mod.</strong> You will use it more than any other arithmetic in code.</p>

  <!--  SECTION 11: FLOOR, CEILING & INTEGER DIVISION                -->
  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <section id="floor-ceil">
    <h2>11. Floor, Ceiling &amp; Integer Division</h2>

    <p>When you divide 7 by 2, the answer is 3.5. But what if you need a whole number? You have two choices: <strong>round down</strong> (floor) or <strong>round up</strong> (ceiling). These aren't just rounding -- they have precise mathematical definitions and they show up in programming <em>constantly</em>.</p>

    <h3>Floor (Round Down)</h3>
    <p>The <strong>floor</strong> of a number is the largest integer that is less than or equal to it. Written as <strong>⌊x⌋</strong>. Think of it as "chopping off the decimal" -- but be careful with negatives.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      ⌊3.7⌋ = 3     (chop off .7 → 3)<br>
      ⌊3.0⌋ = 3     (already whole)<br>
      ⌊0.9⌋ = 0     (not 1! Floor goes DOWN)<br>
      ⌊-2.3⌋ = -3   (NOT -2! Floor goes DOWN, toward more negative)<br>
      ⌊-5.0⌋ = -5   (already whole)
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <div class="label">The Negative Trap</div>
      <p><code>⌊-2.3⌋ = -3</code>, not -2. Floor always goes <strong>toward negative infinity</strong>. This catches people off guard. -3 is less than -2.3, so the floor is -3.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Ceiling (Round Up)</h3>
    <p>The <strong>ceiling</strong> of a number is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to it. Written as <strong>⌈x⌉</strong>. Think of it as "always round up unless already whole."</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      ⌈3.2⌉ = 4     (round up to 4)<br>
      ⌈3.0⌉ = 3     (already whole -- stays at 3)<br>
      ⌈0.1⌉ = 1     (even a tiny decimal rounds up)<br>
      ⌈-2.3⌉ = -2   (round UP toward 0, so -2 not -3)<br>
      ⌈-5.0⌉ = -5   (already whole)
    </div>

    <h3>Integer Division (Truncation)</h3>
    <p>In most programming languages, dividing two integers gives you <strong>integer division</strong> -- the decimal part is thrown away. In C++, Java, and JavaScript (using <code>Math.trunc</code>), this <strong>truncates toward zero</strong>, which is different from floor for negative numbers.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
      Integer division (C++, Java):<br>
       7 / 2 = 3    (not 3.5 -- decimal chopped off)<br>
      -7 / 2 = -3   (truncates toward zero, NOT -4)<br><br>

      Python's // operator (floor division):<br>
       7 // 2 = 3   (same as above)<br>
      -7 // 2 = -4  (floors toward negative infinity!)
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <div class="label">C++ vs Python: Different Behaviour!</div>
      <p><code>-7 / 2</code> in C++ gives <code>-3</code> (truncation). <code>-7 // 2</code> in Python gives <code>-4</code> (floor). This difference has caused countless bugs when porting code between languages. Always test with negative numbers.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Worked Examples</h3>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: How Many Full Pages?</div>
      <p>You have 47 items and show 10 per page. How many pages do you need?</p>
      <p><strong>Wrong answer:</strong> 47 / 10 = 4 (but that only covers 40 items!)</p>
      <p><strong>Right answer:</strong> ⌈47 / 10⌉ = ⌈4.7⌉ = <strong>5 pages</strong></p>
      <p>In code (without a ceiling function): <code>(47 + 10 - 1) / 10 = 56 / 10 = 5</code></p>
      <p>The trick <code>(a + b - 1) / b</code> computes ceiling using only integer division. Memorize this -- it comes up in interviews.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Binary Search Midpoint</div>
      <p>Binary search finds the middle index: <code>mid = (low + high) / 2</code></p>
      <p>If low = 3 and high = 8: mid = 11 / 2 = <strong>5</strong> (integer division, floors automatically)</p>
      <p>If low = 3 and high = 7: mid = 10 / 2 = <strong>5</strong> (exact)</p>
      <p>Integer division naturally gives you the floor, which is exactly what binary search needs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <div class="label">Example: Converting Seconds to HH:MM:SS</div>
      <p>Convert 3725 seconds:</p>
      <p>Hours: <code>3725 / 3600 = 1</code> (integer division)</p>
      <p>Remaining: <code>3725 % 3600 = 125</code></p>
      <p>Minutes: <code>125 / 60 = 2</code></p>
      <p>Seconds: <code>125 % 60 = 5</code></p>
      <p>Result: <strong>1:02:05</strong></p>
      <p>Notice how integer division and mod work together perfectly -- division gives the "big unit," mod gives the leftover.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Relationship: Division, Mod, Floor, and Ceiling</h3>
    <div class="formula-box">
      For any integers a and n:<br><br>
      a = n x (a / n) + (a % n)<br>
      ↑ original = divisor x quotient + remainder<br><br>

      17 = 5 x 3 + 2    ✓ (17 / 5 = 3, 17 % 5 = 2)<br>
      100 = 7 x 14 + 2  ✓ (100 / 7 = 14, 100 % 7 = 2)<br><br>

      Floor and ceiling are related:<br>
      ⌈a/b⌉ = ⌊a/b⌋ + 1  (when a is not divisible by b)<br>
      ⌈a/b⌉ = ⌊a/b⌋      (when a IS divisible by b)
    </div>

    <h3>In Code</h3>
    <div class="formula-box">
      C++:    floor(3.7) = 3    ceil(3.7) = 4     (from &lt;cmath&gt;)<br>
      Python: math.floor(3.7)   math.ceil(3.7)     (import math)<br>
      JS:     Math.floor(3.7)   Math.ceil(3.7)<br><br>

      Integer ceiling without float:  (a + b - 1) / b  (using integer division)<br>
      Example: ceil(47/10) = (47 + 9) / 10 = 56 / 10 = 5  ✓

      <!-- QUESTION 1 -->
      <div class="quiz-q">
        <h4>Q1: What is 3/4 + 1/2?</h4>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, true)">5/4</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">4/6</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">3/8</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">2/3</button>
        <div class="explanation">
          <strong>Answer: 5/4 (or 1 1/4)</strong><br>
          Find the LCD of 4 and 2, which is 4. Convert 1/2 to 2/4. Then add: 3/4 + 2/4 = 5/4. As a mixed number, that is 1 1/4.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- QUESTION 2 -->
      <div class="quiz-q">
        <h4>Q2: What is 5 + 3 x 2^2?</h4>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">32</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, true)">17</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">64</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">22</button>
        <div class="explanation">
          <strong>Answer: 17</strong><br>
          Order of operations: First, exponent: 2^2 = 4. Then multiply: 3 x 4 = 12. Finally add: 5 + 12 = 17.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- QUESTION 3 -->
      <div class="quiz-q">
        <h4>Q3: A jacket originally costs $80 and is 25% off. What is the sale price?</h4>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">$55</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">$65</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, true)">$60</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">$20</button>
        <div class="explanation">
          <strong>Answer: $60</strong><br>
          25% of $80 = 0.25 x 80 = $20. Subtract the discount: $80 - $20 = $60. Or directly: $80 x 0.75 = $60.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- QUESTION 4 -->
      <div class="quiz-q">
        <h4>Q4: What is (-8) x (-3)?</h4>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">-24</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">-11</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, true)">24</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">11</button>
        <div class="explanation">
          <strong>Answer: 24</strong><br>
          When you multiply two negative numbers, the result is positive. Same signs = positive. 8 x 3 = 24, and since both are negative, the answer is positive 24.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- QUESTION 5 -->
      <div class="quiz-q">
        <h4>Q5: If 3/x = 9/12, what is x?</h4>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, true)">4</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">6</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">36</button>
        <button onclick="checkAnswer(this, false)">3</button>
        <div class="explanation">
          <strong>Answer: 4</strong><br>
          Cross-multiply: 3 x 12 = 9 x x, so 36 = 9x, therefore x = 36 / 9 = 4. You can verify: 3/4 = 9/12 = 0.75. Correct!
